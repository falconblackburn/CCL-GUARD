🛡 CyberSecurity AI SOC Platform

An AI-powered Security Operations Center (SOC) simulation platform built using Python and Flask that detects cyber attacks in real time, visualizes threats, manages incidents, sends alerts, blocks malicious IPs, and generates professional incident response reports.

This project demonstrates a complete Blue Team workflow:

Detection → Analysis → Response → Reporting

🚀 Features
### 🌐 Deployment
Hosted on Render

Live URL: https://cybersecurity-ai-soc.onrender.com

### 🔐 Admin Access (Demo Only)

This project is deployed for demonstration purposes.

Admin Panel:
URL: https://cybersecurity-ai-soc.onrender.com

Demo Credentials:
Username: admin
Password: admin123

⚠️ Note:
These credentials are for demo/testing only.
In production, authentication is protected via environment variables and secure hashing.

API Access:
The `/predict` endpoint is publicly exposed for attack simulation via the attack_generator.py script.

No sensitive production data is stored.
